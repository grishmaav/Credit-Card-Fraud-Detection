# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
The term "credit card fraud" refers broadly to theft and fraud that are committed with or  while using a credit card to make a purchase.As the number of con artists rises daily. The use 
of credit cards in fraudulent activity is widespread, and there are many different types of fraud. To solve this issue, many methods including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Random 
Forest, and Naive Bayes algorithms are used. Each aspect of this transaction is considered, and the best course of action is followed. To get a better result, the main goal is to identify fraud by filtering the aforementioned tactics.Fraud and unusual transaction on credit cards can be detected by machine learning algorithms. 
The first and most important phase, after which the model is trained to predict the probability of fraud, is the collection and organization of raw data. In order to detect fraud on credit cards, some of the solutions provided by machine intelligence are as follows: To determine whether a credit card transaction is genuine or false one can use algorithms such as logistic regression, random forests, support machines Vector SVMs), Deep neural network combined with autoencoders, long short term memory LTTMLS Networks and convolutional neural 
networks determining through credit card profiling if someone is using a credit card legitimately or fraudulently.

**The Objectives of this Project are:**
- To detect fraudulent activities in credit card transactions and predict the result.
- Compare some efficient machine learning algorithms, find better accuracy, and suggest a model.
- Visualize dataset through model graphs using Python libraries.
- Integrate machine learning model in the web-based framework for better user interface and user experience.
- To develop an accurate and efficient machine learning model for detecting credit card fraud.
- To integrate the selected machine learning model with the Streamlit web framework to create a user-friendly and interactive interface for fraud detection.
- To provide a reliable and secure fraud detection system that can be deployed to production environments such as web servers or mobile applications.
- To improve the performance of the model using techniques such as oversampling or undersampling, ensemble learning, or hyperparameter tuning.
- To comply with data protection laws and regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) to ensure the 
 privacy and security of the data used for training and testing the model.
- To evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score and identify areas for improvement.
- To provide a solution that can be easily maintained and updated as new data and techniques become available.
- To increase the efficiency and speed of the fraud detection process, thus reducing the time taken to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions.
- To reduce financial losses for individuals and companies that fall victim to credit card fraud.
- To contribute to the advancement of machine learning and data science techniques for fraud detection and prevention.
- To provide a useful tool for financial institutions, merchants, and individuals to monitor their credit card transactions and prevent fraudulent activities.
- To increase awareness about the prevalence of credit card fraud and the importance of using advanced technology to prevent it.
